  abstract = {Opinion mining is a technique extracting and analyzing people's opinions from online communities, and sentiment analysis is a kind of opinion mining analyzing attitudes of people toward an object, whether positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis has evolved alongside natural language processing models and applied to targets such as movie reviews. However, the performing arts have not been subjected to sentiment analysis as movie reviews, despite the apparent need for it. In this study, we used the Korean Funnel Transformer11 language model to perform sentiment analysis on performing arts. This study looks at people's reactions to performing arts in online communities, not just whether they agree or disagree, and shows the problems with applying existing sentiment analysis to performing arts.}
